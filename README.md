greater than or less than
the computer will ask to enter two numbers, and with those two numbers it'll tell the user if they're greater than, less than or equal to each other
peer reviewed by: Freddy Aguilar

The program asks the user to input two numbers and then outputs whether a number chosen is greater than, less than or equal too the other number. The program functions as intended and the data validation makes it so the user doesnt input anything other than what is askd of them. It also includes a feature that allows te program to be replayed. Great job!
